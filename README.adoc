=== Notes
Inspired by the https://github.com/ajhager/sbt-robovm[sbt-robovm plugin]

=== Usage

Include the following in your build.gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url uri('http://dl.bintray.com/yencarnacion/webninjapr-maven')
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.robovm:robovm-compiler:0.0.10'
        classpath group: 'com.webninjapr', name: 'gradle-wn-robovm-plugin', version: '0.0.2'
    }
}
----

And include an extension that looks as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
robovm {
    mainClass= 'HelloJava'
    classpath = runtimeClasspath
}
----

Replace mainClass with your main class.
